** 405 - Shell Lab **

This readme was typed in Vim using the attached Shell program!

To use this program, simply enter 
make shellLab
into your command line and run in your usual way.

You may have to install the GNU readline library to use this shell, but as far as I know it comes with MacOS and Linux distributions.
